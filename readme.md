DigiByte current block rewards end on block 40265288 with 90.29 DGB/block this is a huge drop to 0 and probably way to close to the current date for tx fees to take over.

I propose we change the decay rate of the rewards at block 12993200 from 0.98884 to 0.98652 this will make almost no difference to rewards over the next 5 years but will stretch the rewards phase to block 116731970 with a 0.16 DGB/block reward.

Feel free to try this simulator out.  It will print out a text file with height, reward, supply.  Only heights where reward changes are shown to keep execution time to reasonable length.
